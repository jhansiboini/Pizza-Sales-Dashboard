# Pizza-Sales-Dashboard:SQL & Power BI Analysis
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of pizza sales data to help stakeholders make informed, data-driven decisions. By leveraging SQL for backend analysis and Power BI for the frontend, we identify sales trends, customer preferences, and inventory performance.

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Daily & Monthly Trends: Visualize order volume and revenue fluctuations to identify peak periods.</li>
<li>Category Analysis: Deep dive into pizza categories to understand what drives the most volume.</li>
<li>Size Distribution: Analyze sales by pizza size to optimize inventory and pricing.</li>
<li>Top & Bottom Performers: Identify the highest and lowest selling pizzas based on Revenue, Quantity, and Total Orders.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

</h3>1.Data Analysis (SQL):</h3>
<p>The initial data processing was conducted using SQL. You can find the scripts for data extraction, KPI calculation, and transformation in:
sql_sales_analysis.sql</p>

<h3>2.Interactive Dashboards (Power BI):</h3>
<p>The visual reports are contained within the Power BI project file:
pizza_sales_report.pbix (Requires Power BI Desktop)
</p>


<h2>Creating Dashboards with Power BI</h2>
<ul>
The Power BI report consists of two primary views:
<li>Home Page Dashboard: High-level KPIs, including daily/monthly trends and category distributions.</li>
<li>Best/Worst Sellers Dashboard: Focused insights into specific pizza performance metrics to guide menu optimization.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Dashboard Highlights</h2>
<p>The Power BI report is divided into two strategic dashboards, each designed to answer specific business questions:
</p>

<h3>Executive Summary: Operations & Trends</h3>
<p>This view serves as the primary "Home" dashboard, focusing on high-level Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and temporal data.</p>

<ul>
<li>KPI Tracking: Real-time visibility into Total Revenue, Average Order Value, and Total Pizzas Sold.</li>
<li>Time-Series Analysis: Identification of peak order hours and busiest days of the week to assist in staff scheduling.</li>
<li>Market Share: Visual breakdown of sales by pizza category and size to understand the dominant product mix.</li>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Inventory Intelligence:Best & Worst Sellers </h3>
<p>This specialized view allows stakeholders to perform "Product Performance Analysis" to optimize the menu and reduce waste.</p>
  
<ul>
<li>Revenue Leaders: Identify which pizzas contribute most to the bottom line (Top 5 by Revenue).</li>
<li>Volume Drivers: See which items have the highest turnover (Top 5 by Quantity).</li>
<li>Underperformers: Isolate the "Worst Sellers" to make data-backed decisions on menu removals or promotional discounts.</li>
</ul>

<li>Navigate the Reports: Use the navigation pane or the tabs located at the bottom (or side) of the screen to switch between the Home Page and the Best/Worst Sellers report.</li>
<li>Engage with the Data * Filter & Slice: Use the slicers (e.g., date ranges or categories) to narrow down specific data points.</li>
<li>Drill-Through: Click on specific chart elements to see the underlying data for that category.</li>
<li>Tooltips: Hover your mouse over any bar or line chart to view detailed pop-up metrics.</li>
</ol>
